# Freighter vs SAFU: Contract Deployment Comparison

## üîç **Key Discovery: Freighter uses the SAME approach as us!**

Based on analyzing Freighter's source code, here's what I found:

## **Freighter's Contract Deployment Process**

### 1. **Transaction Building** (Done by dApp, not Freighter)
- Applications build deployment transactions using Stellar SDK
- Uses `Operation.uploadContractWasm()` and `Operation.createCustomContract()`
- Calls `server.prepareTransaction()` for Soroban resource estimation
- **This is IDENTICAL to our approach**

### 2. **Transaction Signing** (Done by Freighter)
```typescript
// From signTransaction.ts
const sourceKeys = Sdk.Keypair.fromSecret(privateKey);
transactionToSign.sign(sourceKeys);
response = transactionToSign.toXDR();
```
- **This is IDENTICAL to SAFU's signing process**

### 3. **UI Display** (Freighter-specific)
- Shows "Upload Contract Wasm" or "Create Contract" 
- Displays WASM hash, salt, executable type
- **This is just UI - doesn't affect transaction processing**

## **Critical Insight: No Special Deployment Logic**

üéØ **Freighter does NOT have special contract deployment functions!**

- No `uploadContractWasm()` API method
- No `createCustomContract()` API method  
- Uses generic `signTransaction()` for everything
- Applications build deployment transactions, Freighter just signs them

## **So Why Is SAFU Failing?**

Since Freighter uses the exact same approach as us, the issue must be:

### **1. Transaction Building Differences**
Our transaction building might differ from what works with Freighter:
- Fee calculation
- Resource estimation  
- XDR formatting
- Soroban preparation

### **2. Network/RPC Differences**
- Different Soroban RPC endpoints
- Different network configurations
- Different resource limits

### **3. SAFU-Specific Issues**
- Authentication timing
- XDR parsing requirements
- Signing format expectations

### **4. SDK Version Differences**
- Freighter might use different Stellar SDK version
- Different transaction preparation methods

## **Next Debugging Steps**

1. **Test Freighter deployment**: Try deploying same contract via Freighter
2. **Compare XDR**: See if Freighter generates different transaction XDR
3. **Check SDK versions**: Compare Stellar SDK versions between Freighter and our code
4. **Network settings**: Verify RPC endpoints and network configurations match

## **The Good News**

‚úÖ **SAFU's signing approach is correct** - it matches Freighter exactly
‚úÖ **Contract deployment via wallet IS possible** - Freighter proves it works
‚úÖ **Our integration pattern is right** - build transaction, sign via wallet API

The issue is likely in transaction building details, not the fundamental approach!
