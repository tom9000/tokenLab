Token Lab is a SEP-41 Token smart contract deployment and management dapp.

The wallet main priority is to work with Stellar / Soroban. We are using Futurenet by default.

The project including the docs folder is in /Users/Mac/code/-scdev/tokenLab/.

The folder /Users/Mac/code/-scdev/safu-dev/ is the project of the wallet that we will use for connecting Token Lab.

The github project is https://github.com/tom9000/tokenLab

We are using port :3005 for the vite server.

Please don't run individual commands to kill and start the server. Use this script instead ~/restart-tokenlab.sh
