# Contract Deployment Analysis: Freighter vs SAFU Integration

## üìã **Executive Summary**

After analyzing Freighter's open-source codebase and comparing it with our SAFU wallet integration, we've identified that **both wallets use identical contract deployment patterns**. This confirms our integration approach is fundamentally correct, but reveals specific technical issues preventing SAFU deployment from succeeding.

## üîç **Key Findings**

### **1. Identical Architecture Patterns**

| Component | Freighter | SAFU Wallet | Status |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Transaction Building | dApp builds with Stellar SDK | dApp builds with Stellar SDK | ‚úÖ Same |
| Soroban Preparation | `server.prepareTransaction()` | `server.prepareTransaction()` | ‚úÖ Same |
| Signing Method | `signTransaction(xdr)` API | `signTransaction(xdr)` API | ‚úÖ Same |
| Authentication | Extension-based auth | Agent mode auth | üîß Different |
| UI Display | Shows deployment details | N/A (headless) | ‚ûñ Not applicable |

### **2. No Special Deployment Functions**

**Critical Discovery**: Neither wallet implements special deployment functions like:
- ‚ùå `wallet.uploadContractWasm()`
- ‚ùå `wallet.createCustomContract()`
- ‚ùå `wallet.deployContract()`

Instead, both use:
‚úÖ `wallet.signTransaction(deploymentXdr)`

### **3. Current Integration Status**

| Feature | Status | Evidence |
|---------|--------|----------|
| SAFU Authentication | ‚úÖ Working | Fresh tokens generated successfully |
| Transaction Signing | ‚úÖ Working | All transaction types sign correctly |
| Network Submission | ‚úÖ Working | Signed transactions submit to Futurenet |
| Contract Operations | ‚úÖ Working | Balance, transfer operations functional |
| **Contract Deployment** | ‚ùå Failing | `txBadAuth` (-6) error during WASM upload |
| Token Sending | ‚ö†Ô∏è Blocked | Requires successful deployment with SAFU as admin |

## üö® **Root Cause Analysis**

### **The Deployment Failure**

```javascript
// Current Error
{
  "status": "ERROR",
  "errorResult": {
    "_attributes": {
      "result": {
        "_switch": {
          "name": "txBadAuth",
          "value": -6
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### **Error Code Analysis**

`txBadAuth` (-6) indicates **authentication/authorization failure**, which is puzzling because:

‚úÖ **SAFU signing works perfectly** - transaction is signed correctly  
‚úÖ **Account is funded** - sufficient XLM for fees  
‚úÖ **Network access works** - other transactions submit successfully  
‚ùå **Something in deployment auth fails** - specific to WASM upload operations

### **Hypothesis: Transaction Preparation Issues**

The failure occurs **after** successful signing, suggesting:

1. **Resource Footprint Problems**: Soroban resource estimation may be incompatible with SAFU's auth context
2. **Fee Structure Issues**: Deployment transactions require specific fee patterns
3. **Timing Issues**: Auth context may expire between preparation and submission
4. **XDR Format Issues**: SAFU may expect specific transaction formatting

  - Fee calculations
  - Resource footprints
  - Auth signatures
  - Soroban data

#### **1.3 SDK Version Audit**
- [ ] Check Freighter's Stellar SDK version
- [ ] Compare with our current SDK version (v14.0.0-rc.3)
- [ ] Identify any version-specific deployment changes

### **Phase 2: SAFU Integration Debugging** ‚è±Ô∏è *3-4 hours*

#### **2.1 Transaction Building Refinement**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk Assessment**

### **High Probability Risks**
- **SDK Compatibility**: Different SDK versions may require code updates
- **Network Changes**: Futurenet updates could affect deployment patterns
- **SAFU Updates**: Wallet updates might change authentication requirements

### **Mitigation Strategies**
- Maintain multiple deployment approaches (SDK + CLI hybrid)
- Version pin dependencies for stability
- Implement comprehensive error handling and retry logic

### **Fallback Options**
1. **CLI Deployment + SAFU Operations**: Proven working approach
2. **Multi-wallet Support**: Add Freighter as alternative for deployment
3. **Manual Deployment**: CLI deployment with manual SAFU configuration

## üìù **Next Steps**

**Immediate Action**: Begin Phase 1 with Freighter deployment test to establish baseline comparison.

**Timeline**: Complete analysis and working solution within 8-12 hours of focused development.

**Success Definition**: SAFU wallet successfully deploys, initializes, mints, and sends SEP-41 tokens end-to-end.
