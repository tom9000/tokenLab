# Freighter Testing Instructions

## üéØ **Phase 1.1: Testing Setup Complete**

We've successfully built Freighter and created a deployment test page. Here's how to proceed:

## **‚úÖ What's Ready**

1. **Freighter Extension Built**: `/Users/mac/code/-scdev/tokenLab/freighter/extension/build/`
2. **Test Page Created**: `/Users/mac/code/-scdev/tokenLab/test-freighter-deployment.html`
3. **SDK Version Confirmed**: Freighter uses identical `@stellar/stellar-sdk@14.0.0-rc.3`

## **üìã Next Steps for Testing**

### **1. Install Freighter Extension**

1. **Open Chrome/Firefox**
2. **Go to Extensions**: `chrome://extensions/` or `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
3. **Enable Developer Mode**
4. **Load Unpacked Extension**: Select `/Users/mac/code/-scdev/tokenLab/freighter/extension/build/`
5. **Pin Extension** to toolbar for easy access

### **2. Open Test Page**

1. **Open**: `/Users/mac/code/-scdev/tokenLab/test-freighter-deployment.html` in browser
2. **Check Console**: Look for "Freighter API detected" message
3. **Connect Wallet**: Click "Connect to Freighter" button

### **3. Run Deployment Test**

1. **Ensure Account is Funded**: Test account needs XLM for fees
2. **Click "Deploy Contract"**: This will run the full deployment
3. **Monitor Log**: Watch the step-by-step process
4. **Capture Results**: Success/failure and any error messages

### **4. Expected Test Results**

**If Successful:**
- ‚úÖ WASM uploads without errors
- ‚úÖ Contract instance created
- ‚úÖ Contract initialized with Freighter account as admin
- ‚úÖ Transaction XDR available for download

**If Failed:**
- ‚ùå Same `txBadAuth` error as SAFU (confirms issue is not wallet-specific)
- ‚ùå Different error (reveals Freighter vs SAFU differences)

## **üìä Data Collection**

### **Success Case**
- [ ] Contract address
- [ ] WASM hash
- [ ] Transaction XDRs (download via button)
- [ ] Network transaction hashes
- [ ] Console logs

### **Failure Case**
- [ ] Error messages
- [ ] Error codes
- [ ] Transaction XDRs (if generated)
- [ ] Console logs
- [ ] Network responses

## **üîÑ Comparison with SAFU**

Once Freighter test completes, compare:

| Aspect | Freighter | SAFU | Match? |
|--------|-----------|------|--------|
| SDK Version | `14.0.0-rc.3` | `14.0.0-rc.3` | ‚úÖ |
| Transaction Building | TBD | Known | TBD |
| Fee Calculation | TBD | `BASE_FEE * 200000` | TBD |
| Resource Preparation | TBD | `server.prepareTransaction()` | TBD |
| Signing Process | TBD | Works perfectly | TBD |
| Network Submission | TBD | `txBadAuth` error | TBD |

## **üöÄ Expected Outcomes**

### **Scenario A: Freighter Succeeds**
- **Conclusion**: SAFU-specific issue in transaction building/auth
- **Next**: Debug SAFU transaction preparation differences
- **Action**: Fix SAFU implementation based on working Freighter pattern

### **Scenario B: Freighter Fails with Same Error**
- **Conclusion**: General Soroban deployment issue (not wallet-specific)
- **Next**: Investigate network/RPC/SDK issues
- **Action**: Try different approaches (CLI hybrid, different RPC, etc.)

### **Scenario C: Freighter Fails with Different Error**  
- **Conclusion**: Different failure modes reveal specific issues
- **Next**: Analyze both error patterns
- **Action**: Fix both wallet integrations based on findings

## **‚è∞ Timeline**

- **Setup**: 15 minutes (install extension, open test page)
- **Testing**: 30 minutes (run deployment, capture results)
- **Analysis**: 15 minutes (compare with SAFU results)
- **Total**: ~1 hour

## **üéØ Success Metrics**

- [ ] Freighter extension installed and functional
- [ ] Test page connects to Freighter successfully
- [ ] Deployment test runs (success or failure both valuable)
- [ ] Complete data captured for comparison
- [ ] Clear next steps identified based on results

**Ready to proceed!** üöÄ

The test infrastructure is complete. Running this test will definitively show whether the deployment issue is SAFU-specific or affects all wallets.
